# CS235_Data_Mining_Solar_Power_Generation

This project implements various Regression algorrithms to predict the Solar Power Generated by a Solar Panel using the data from [The Solar Power Generation Dataset]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data)).  

The implemented algorithms are:  
1: Gaussian Process Regression  
2: Support Vector Regression  
3: Random Sampling Consensus (RANSAC)  
4: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) Regession  
5: A proposed Deep Neural Network Architecture  

The code can be run using Colaboratory Notebooks by following the steps given below:  
1: Import any one of the notebooks to Colaboratory.  
2: Add the Dataset.xlsx file to your drive account to which you will have to allow Colab access when running the notebook.  
3: Run all the cells in the colab notebook and watch the magic unfold! :)
